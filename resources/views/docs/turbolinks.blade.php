Livewire recommends you use Turbolinks in your apps to make page transitions faster. It is very possible to achieve a "SPA" feeling application written with Turbolinks & Livewire.

If you have Turbolinks installed on the page ([installation instructions here](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks)), Livewire should handle the rest.
